        <h2>Introduction About Sea Otters</h2>
        <p> Sea Otters scientific name is (<em>Enhydra lutris</em>). Sea otters are mammals.Their average lifespan in the wild is up to 23 years!
          They grow up to around 4 feet long with an average weight of 65 pounds.Sea otters are a keystone species, meaning their role in their 
          environment has a greater effect than other species. As top predators, sea otters are critical to maintaining the balance of 
          nearshore ecosystems, such as kelp forests.Without sea otters, sea urchins can overpopulate the sea floor and devour the kelp forests 
          that provide cover and food for many other marine animals.</p>

        <h2> The Habitat of a Sea Otter</h2>
        <p> Sea otters are found in a variety of coastal marine habitats, including rocky shores and sea-bottoms, sandy sea-bottoms, as well as 
          coastal wetlands. Sea otters naturally inhabit offshore areas with an abundance of food and kelp canopy. Sea Otters can be found along the 
          coasts of the Pacific Ocean in North America and Asia. The sea otter spends most of its time in the water but, in some locations, comes ashore to sleep or rest.</p>

      <div id="Diet" class="text-center">
        <h2>The Diet of a Sea Otter</h2>
        <p>eat mostly hard-shelled invertebrates, including sea urchins and a variety of clams, mussels, chitons, snails, prawns, crabs, abalone, squid, sea star legs and in some areas, 
          several species of fish. Sea otters use their sense of touch to find food; diving sea otters feel for food along the ocean floor with their sensitive front paws.
          Sea otters dive to rocky reefs, where they collect invertebrates and also a large rock. Upon returning to the surface, they float on their backs, with the rock on the stomachs.
          They use the rock as a table against which they smash their shelled prey to get to the soft parts that they can eat</p>

      <h2>Intresting facts about Sea Otters</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Sea otters are a keystone species, meaning their role in their environment has a greater effect than other species. As top predators, sea otters are critical to maintaining the balance 
        of nearshore ecosystems, such as kelp forests</li>
      <li>Without sea otters, sea urchins can overpopulate the sea floor and devour the kelp forests that provide cover and food for many other marine animals. By maintaining healthy kelp forests, 
        sea otters also indirectly help to reduce levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, a prevalent greenhouse gas, as kelp absorbs and sequesters carbon.</li>
      <li>A group of otters is called a romp</li>
      <li>Otters may look permanently soaked, but their remarkable fur, which grows in a density of 26,000 to 165,000 hairs per square centimetre of skin keeps them cozy. They keep their underfur dry
        by blowing into the fur with their mouths to puff it up.</li>
      <li>Otters hold hand to keep from drifting away. When other otters aren’t available, they’ve been known to wrap themselves in seaweed to stay anchored.</li>

<div id="secondpage" class="All text-center">
    <h2 class="text-center"> What family? </h1>
    <p>Sea Otters are part of the Mustelidae family. The Mustelidae family is made up of carnivorous mammals that
       includes skunks, weasels, wolverines and badgers. The sea otter is the largest member of the weasel family, yet the smallest marine mammal in North America! 
       Mustelids are a diverse group, they comprise about 56–60 species across eight subfamilies.</p>

  <div>
    <h2 class="text-center"> Family atrubutes and charaterisics</h2>
    <p>Many mustelids have a long tube-shaped body. Many also have short legs, and a strong, thick neck with a small head. 
      All have well-developed anal scent glands. The five digits on each foot are equipped with sharp nonretractile claws. 
      Males are usually larger than females; among some weasels males are almost twice as large.Mustelids are also very active and
      inquisitive in their constant search for prey as they have a high metabolism.Their high metabolism is partly due to their themtubular body as it does not 
      retain heat as well as a stockier body of the same weight and is therefore associated with higher metabolism.</p>
